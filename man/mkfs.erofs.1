.SH NAME
mkfs.erofs \- tool to create an EROFS filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmkfs.erofs\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIDESTINATION\fR \fISOURCE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
EROFS is a new enhanced lightweight linux read-only filesystem with modern
designs (eg. no buffer head, reduced metadata, inline xattrs/data, etc.) for
scenarios which need high-performance read-only requirements, e.g. Android OS
for smartphones and LIVECDs.
.PP
It also provides fixed-sized output compression support, which improves storage
density, keeps relatively higher compression ratios, which is more useful to
achieve high performance for embedded devices with limited memory since it has
unnoticable memory overhead and page cache thrashing.
.PP
mkfs.erofs is used to create such EROFS filesystem \fIDESTINATION\fR image file
from \fISOURCE\fR directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-z " compression-algorithm " [" ",#" "]" " [:" " ... " "]"
Set a primary algorithm for data compression, which can be set with an optional
compression level (1 to 12 for LZ4HC, 0 to 9 for LZMA and 100 to 109 for LZMA
extreme compression) separated by a comma.  Alternative algorithms could be
specified and separated by colons.
.TP
.BI "\-C " max-pcluster-size
Specify the maximum size of compress physical cluster in bytes. It may enable
big pcluster feature if needed (Linux v5.13+).
.TP
.BI "\-d " #
Specify the level of debugging messages. The default is 2, which shows basic
warning messages.
.TP
.BI "\-x " #
Specify the upper limit of an xattr which is still inlined. The default is 2.
Disable storing xattrs if < 0.
.TP
.BI "\-E " extended-option " [,...]"
Set extended options for the filesystem. Extended options are comma separated,
and may take an extra argument using the equals ('=') sign.
The following extended options are supported:
.RS 1.2i
.TP
.BI all-fragments
Forcely record the whole files into a special inode for better compression and
it may take an argument as the pcluster size of the packed inode in bytes.
(Linux v6.1+)
.TP
.BI dedupe
Enable global compressed data deduplication to minimize duplicated data in
the filesystem. It may be used with \fI-Efragments\fR option together to
further reduce image sizes. (Linux v6.1+)
.TP
.BI force-inode-compact
Forcely generate compact inodes (32-byte inodes) to output.
.TP
.BI force-inode-extended
Forcely generate extended inodes (64-byte inodes) to output.
.TP
.BI force-inode-blockmap
Forcely generate inode chunk format in 4-byte block address array.
.TP
.BI force-chunk-indexes
Forcely generate inode chunk format in 8-byte chunk indexes (with device id).
.TP
.BI fragments
Pack the tail part (pcluster) of compressed files or the whole files into a
special inode for smaller image sizes, and it may take an argument as the
pcluster size of the packed inode in bytes. (Linux v6.1+)
.TP
.BI legacy-compress
Drop "inplace decompression" and "compacted indexes" support, which is used
to generate compatible EROFS images for Linux v4.19 - 5.3.
.TP
.BI noinline_data
Don't inline regular files to enable FSDAX for these files (Linux v5.15+).
.TP
.BI ztailpacking
Pack the tail part (pcluster) of compressed files into its metadata to save
more space and the tail part I/O. (Linux v5.17+)
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-L " volume-label
Set the volume label for the filesystem to
.IR volume-label .
The maximum length of the volume label is 16 bytes.
.TP
.BI "\-T " #
Set all files to the given UNIX timestamp. Reproducible builds requires setting
all to a specific one.
.TP
.BI "\-U " UUID
Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the filesystem to
.IR UUID .
The format of the UUID is a series of hex digits separated by hyphens,
like this: "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".
.TP
.B \-\-all-root
Make all files owned by root.
.TP
.BI "\-\-blobdev " file
Specify another extra blob device to store chunk-based data.
.TP
.BI "\-\-chunksize " #
Generate chunk-based files with #-byte chunks.
.TP
.BI "\-\-compress-hints " file
If the optional
.BI "\-\-compress-hints " file
argument is given,
.B mkfs.erofs
uses it to apply the per-file compression strategy. Each line is defined by
tokens separated by spaces in the following form.  Optionally, instead of
the given primary algorithm, alternative algorithms could be specified with
\fIalgorithm-index\fR by hand:
.RS 1.2i
<pcluster-in-bytes> [algorithm-index] <match-pattern>
.RE
.TP
.BI "\-\-exclude-path=" path
Ignore file that matches the exact literal path.
You may give multiple `--exclude-path' options.
.TP
.BI "\-\-exclude-regex=" regex
Ignore files that match the given regular expression.
You may give multiple `--exclude-regex` options.
.TP
.BI "\-\-file-contexts=" file
Specify a \fIfile_contexts\fR file to setup / override selinux labels.
.TP
.BI "\-\-force-uid=" UID
Set all file uids to \fIUID\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-\-force-gid=" GID
Set all file gids to \fIGID\fR.
.TP
.BI "\-\-gid-offset=" GIDOFFSET
Add \fIGIDOFFSET\fR to all file gids.
When this option is used together with --force-gid, the final file gids are
set to \fIGID\fR + \fIGID-OFFSET\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Display this help and exit.
.TP
.B "\-\-ignore-mtime"
File modification time is ignored whenever it would cause \fBmkfs.erofs\fR to
use extended inodes over compact inodes. When not using a fixed timestamp, this
can reduce total metadata size.
.TP
.BI "\-\-max-extent-bytes " #
Specify maximum decompressed extent size # in bytes.
.TP
.B "\-\-preserve-mtime"
File modification time is preserved whenever \fBmkfs.erofs\fR decides to use
extended inodes over compact inodes.
.TP
.BI "\-\-uid-offset=" UIDOFFSET
Add \fIUIDOFFSET\fR to all file uids.
When this option is used together with --force-uid, the final file uids are
set to \fIUID\fR + \fIUIDOFFSET\fR.
