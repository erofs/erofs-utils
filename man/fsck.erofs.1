.SH NAME
fsck.erofs \- tool to check an EROFS filesystem's integrity
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfsck.erofs\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR] \fIIMAGE\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
fsck.erofs is used to scan an EROFS filesystem \fIIMAGE\fR and check the
integrity of it.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number of fsck.erofs and exit.
.TP

warning messages.

non-compressed files.

You may give multiple
.B --device
options in the correct order.
.TP
.BI "\-\-extract" "[=directory]"
Test to extract the whole file system. It scans all inode data, including
compressed inode data, which leads to more I/O and CPU load, so it might
take a long time depending on the image size.

Optionally extract contents of the \fIIMAGE\fR to \fIdirectory\fR.
.TP
.B "--no-sbcrc"
Bypass the on-disk superblock checksum verification.
.TP
.BI "--[no-]xattrs"
Whether to dump extended attributes during extraction (default off).
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help string and exit.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-A\fR, \fB-y\fR
These options do nothing at all; they are provided only for compatibility with
the fsck programs of other filesystems.
